**Introduction**  
Your friend Eliud inherited a farm from her grandma Tigist. Her granny was an inventor and had a tendency to build things in an overly complicated manner. The chicken coop has a digital display showing an encoded number representing the positions of all eggs that could be picked up.

Eliud is asking you to write a program that shows the actual number of eggs in the coop.

The position information encoding is calculated as follows:

1. Scan the potential egg-laying spots and mark down a 1 for an existing egg or a 0 for an empty spot.
2. Convert the number from binary to decimal.
3. Show the result on the display.

**Instructions**  
Your task is to count the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a number.

**Restrictions**  
Keep your hands off that bit-count functionality provided by your standard library! Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.
